Besides well-known sites such as <a href='http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/'>Perseus</a> or the German Bible Society's <a href='http://www.academic-bible.com/en/home/'>Academic Bible Portal</a>, there are also older or lesser known projects, like the <a href='http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/rak/catss.html'>Computer Assisted Tools for Septuagint/Scriptural Study</a>.\n",

The second part represents the part of speech, here a verb.  The next part is an 8-part parsing code.  This one tells us that the verb is a `3`rd person `A`orist `A`ctive `I`ndicative `S`ingular verb form.  The final four parts represent the text of the word in different states: 1) exactly as it appears in the text, 2) without punctuation, 3) normalized, and 4) lemma.

      "**3)** In this final exercise we will put everything together what we have learnt so far. We want you to write a function `verses_with` that takes as input a word and the dictionary you want to search and returns the verses in the NT in which a given word occurs. We are not worried about the number of occurrences, only whether it occurs.  The result for each word should be a list with each element being another list that has three elements, the book name, chapter, and verse in which the word occurs, e.g., `[['Mt', 1, 1], ['Mt', 1, 2]]`.  Use that function to find all occurences of the name \u1f38\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 and store the corresponding results in the variable `verses_with_Jesus`. Do the same thing for \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2. Store the result in `verses_with_God`. Finally, find all occurences of \u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u1fe6\u03bc\u03b1 and store the indexes in `verses_with_Spirit`. Tip: (1) remember that we built our NT_dict using inflected forms of the words (2) remember that indexes start at 0."

      "OK, we have seen the `key` argument on the `sorted` function, but what is that `lambda` thing?  `lambda` is essentially Python's way of building mini functions.  It essentially says, \"For a value we shall call _x_, do the following thing with it.\"  In this case, what we do is use the value of _x_ to look up a value in the list `NT_book_order`.  You need to remember that `sorted` goes through every member of the list `NT_verses` and passes the value of that member to the `key` argument.  `lambda` picks up the value that is passed to `key` as _x_ and, in this case, uses the first member of the list _x_ to figure out how it should order the members of `NT_verses`.  \n",

      "Now, the last step is to produce a list of the numerical positions of every occurrence of each of our words.  To do this, you should write a function below that takes as input a list of the book, chapter, and verses for the occurrence of a word and another list with the books, chapters, and verses for the whole NT and will return a list that has the relative positions for that word in the whole NT represented as a float."
