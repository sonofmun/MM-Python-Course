We want you to write a function `verses_with` that takes as input a word and the dictionary you want to search and returns the verses in the NT in which a given word occurs. We are not worried about the number of occurrences, only whether it occurs.  The result for each word should be a list with each element being another list that has three elements, the book name, chapter, and verse in which the word occurs, e.g., `[['Mt', 1, 1], ['Mt', 1, 2]]`.  Use that function to find all occurences of the name \u1f38\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 and store the corresponding results in the variable `verses_with_Jesus`. Do the same thing for \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2. Store the result in `verses_with_God`. Finally, find all occurences of \u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u1fe6\u03bc\u03b1 and store the indexes in `verses_with_Spirit`. Tip: (1) remember that we built our NT_dict using inflected forms of the words (2) remember that indexes start at 0."
